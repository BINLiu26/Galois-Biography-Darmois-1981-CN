# 《伽罗瓦传》（1981）数字复原项目  
### *Digital Restoration Project of "Évariste Galois" (1981)*

本项目由刘彬于2025年独立完成，原书为 A. 达尔玛（André Darmois）所著传记，由邵循岱翻译，1981年由商务印书馆出版。本书长期未再版、无电子化版本，几近绝迹。  
This project was independently completed by Bin Liu in 2025. The original book is a biography of Évariste Galois written by André Darmois, translated by Shao Xundai, and published in 1981 by The Commercial Press (商务印书馆). The book has never been reprinted or digitized, and has become nearly extinct.

本版本由实体藏本逐页扫描、手动校对、排版修复而成，现作为数字结构锚点公开发布，用于历史研究、数学思想史、结构主义传记学参考。  
This edition was created by scanning a physical library copy page by page, followed by manual proofreading and typographic restoration. It is now publicly released as a digital structural anchor, intended for use in historical research, the intellectual history of mathematics, and structuralist biography studies.
